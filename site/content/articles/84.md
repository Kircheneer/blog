Recently I've been working on adding type hints (see
[PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/ "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/")) to the Network
Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support
([NAPALM](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/")). This was my first
more-or-less major open source contribution so I though it might be interesting to elaborate on the process. Type hints
in combination with a type checker such as [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/ "http://mypy-lang.org/") allow for static
analysis of Python programs (which are normally dynamically typed). The following code is a example of a type hinted
function.

```python
def sum_and_multiply(a: typing.List[int], b: int) -> int:
    return sum(a) * b
```

To start off I decided to only tackle the `NXOS` driver and the base `NetworkDriver` class, because type hinting all of the

## Prerequisites

Running Mypy against the submodule `napalm.base` with the `disallow-untyped-defs` flag yielded more than 600 errors
prior to the changes I made.

```python
$ mypy -p napalm.base --disallow-untyped-defs
[...]
Found 655 errors in 34 files (checked 25 source files)
```

These mostly consist of untyped function or method definitions. Another common error is an import that doesn't implement
type hints. At the time of writing, not a lot of dependencies of NAPALM implement type hints. I found my starting point
in all of this in the models used for testing the
[getter methods](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#getters-support-matrix "https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#getters-support-matrix"),
which are NAPALMs way of (vendor-independantly) getting data from network devices in a common form. The following is an
excerpt from `napalm.base.test.models` showing the model that `get_facts` is tested against before any work towards
type hints was done.

```python
facts = {
    "os_version": str,
    "uptime": int,
    "interface_list": list,
    "vendor": str,
    "serial_number": str,
    "model": str,
    "hostname": str,
    "fqdn": str,
}
```

All the models were present in this format, which allows the unit tests to check, if the getter output data conforms to
this format. Unfortunately, the following is not possible with this format:

```python
class ExampleDriver:
    def get_facts(self) -> facts:
        pass
```

Fortunately though, the `typing` module (or the `typing_extensions` module prior to Python 3.7) provides a Type called
`TypedDict` (see [PEP589](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/)). This allows for more granularity than the
standard `Dict` annotation, which allows generic keys in the dictionary. A `TypedDict` for the above model could look
like this (using the alternative syntax for ease of migration).

```python
FactsDict = TypedDict(
    "FactsDict",
    {
        "os_version": str,
        "uptime": int,
        "interface_list": List,
        "vendor": str,
        "serial_number": str,
        "model": str,
        "hostname": str,
        "fqdn": str,
    },
)
```

Note that not much has actually changed here, but we can now use this type in type hints for our `get_facts` function
from earlier.

```python
class ExampleDriver:
    def get_facts(self) -> Facts:
        pass
```

## Type hinting the base class

With most of the data modeling out of the the next step was putting in the actual type hints. Any NAPALM driver (in
the core module or a 3rd party one) has to inherit the `NetworkDriver` class from `napalm.base.base`. This therefore
looked like a great starting point for adding type hints. After all the models were converted to `TypedDict` instances,
I was able to annotate a lot of the methods with just those models. While type hinting the code base further I found
lots of errors with the models I made in the first step so I gradually iterated on those until they worked for both the
NXOS SSH and NXAPI drivers
